# FoundKey
FoundKey is a free and open source microblogging server compatible with ActivityPub. Forked from Misskey, FoundKey improves on maintainability and behaviour, while also bringing in useful features.

See the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) and [roadmap](./ROADMAP.md) for more on what's changed and future plans.

## Documentation
FoundKey's documentation is a work in progress. In the meantime, much of the documentation on the [Misskey Hub](https://misskey-hub.net/) will also apply to FoundKey.
