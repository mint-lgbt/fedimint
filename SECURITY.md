# Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security issue in Foundkey, please report it by sending an
email to [johann@qwertqwefsday.eu](mailto:johann@qwertqwefsday.eu).

This will allow us to assess the risk, and make a fix available before we add a
bug report to the repository.

Thanks for helping make Foundkey safe for everyone.
